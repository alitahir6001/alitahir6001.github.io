                        "I'm a software developer who solves problems with a behavior researcher's mindset.

                        After my family immigrated to Washington DC when I was barely 7 years old, I spent my most impressionable years in a vibrant and varied environment in and outside the city. It was these eclectic and diverse surroundings that seeded my curiousity about people, ultimately leading to studying it at The University of Texas San Antonio. Years of behavioral research and statistical analysis taught me to value evidence over fads and to analyze the 'cognitive architecture' of how people think.
                        This foundation in psychology is my greatest strength in tech, allowing me to [insert what you do now, e.g., 'design systems with a deep understanding of the end-user' or 'approach development with a high-level of analytical rigor']."

            <p>
                While my passion for behavior psychology was strong, the Covid-19 Pandemic radically shifted my direction. Fascinated (and frankly, terrified) at the unfolding events of 2020, I saw technology not just as a tool, but as the most powerful lever available to apply insights about human behavior at scale during an historic moment in the history of mankind. Through rigorous self-teaching coupled with the high-intensity structure of a coding bootcamp, this led me to a career in software engineering, where I had the privilege of working on mission-critical systems at an enterprise level to understand how this new indsutry I adopted. I traded in my research and service exeprience for a terminal and haven't looked back since.

            <blockquote>
                "Technology and psychology are two sides of the same coin. Both seek to create systems—one in silicon, one in the mind—that produce predictable, desirable outcomes."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>The Synthesis: The "Why" Behind Pocket Professor</h3>
            <p>
                Pocket Professor is the culmination of this dual journey. It's a project born from the realization that the biggest problem in self-guided learning isn't a lack of information, but a lack of a clear path forward and psychologically sound framework. The internet is full of "what" to learn, but it offers very little guidance on "how" to learn effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background in research made me deeply skeptical of popular neuromyths like "learning styles." Instead, I knew the real key was in leveraging proven, evidence-based learning mechanics. This is the core thesis of Pocket Professor: to build a tool that doesn't just give you a list of topics, but actively facilitates the cognitive processes that lead to true, lasting knowledge—principles like Active Recall, Spaced Repetition, and Desirable Difficulties.

            <h3>The Mission</h3>
            <p>
                This project is for people like me: the motivated, mid-career professional who stood at the edge of a chasm, wanting to make a change but paralyzed by the overwhelming chaos of self-education. My mission is to build the structured, confidence-building bridge people like me need to get to the other side, without the absurd time and financial cost associated with undertaking such an endeavor. I believe when truly motivated individuals are armed with the right tools and have a clear path forward, they have potential to learn anything.
