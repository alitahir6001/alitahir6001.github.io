                    <h3>The Origin: A Foundation in "Why"</h3>
                    <p>
                        My journey didn't start at the command line, it started with a question: "Why do we behave the way we do?" This curiosity stems from my experience as part of a first-generation immigrant family. From Southeast D.C. and Columbia Heights to the Northern VA suburbs and the challenges we faced along the way. It led toward to a deep dive into experimental psychology, where I spent years immersed in behavior research, experimental design, and statistical analysis. This foundation gave me a unique lens on the world—a focus on evidence, a skepticism of fads, and a deep appreciation for the cognitive architecture that governs how we absorb information.

            <h3>The Pivot: From Human Code to Computer Code</h3>

            <p>
                While my passion for behavior psychology was strong, the Covid-19 Pandemic radically shifted my direction. Fascinated (and frankly, terrified) at the unfolding events of 2020, I saw technology not just as a tool, but as the most powerful lever available to apply insights about human behavior at scale during an historic moment in the history of mankind. Through rigorous self-teaching coupled with the high-intensity structure of a coding bootcamp, this led me to a career in software engineering, where I had the privilege of working on mission-critical systems at an enterprise level to understand how this new indsutry I adopted. I traded in my research and service exeprience for a terminal and haven't looked back since.

            <blockquote>
                "Technology and psychology are two sides of the same coin. Both seek to create systems—one in silicon, one in the mind—that produce predictable, desirable outcomes."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>The Synthesis: The "Why" Behind Pocket Professor</h3>
            <p>
                Pocket Professor is the culmination of this dual journey. It's a project born from the realization that the biggest problem in self-guided learning isn't a lack of information, but a lack of a clear path forward and psychologically sound framework. The internet is full of "what" to learn, but it offers very little guidance on "how" to learn effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background in research made me deeply skeptical of popular neuromyths like "learning styles." Instead, I knew the real key was in leveraging proven, evidence-based learning mechanics. This is the core thesis of Pocket Professor: to build a tool that doesn't just give you a list of topics, but actively facilitates the cognitive processes that lead to true, lasting knowledge—principles like Active Recall, Spaced Repetition, and Desirable Difficulties.

            <h3>The Mission</h3>
            <p>
                This project is for people like me: the motivated, mid-career professional who stood at the edge of a chasm, wanting to make a change but paralyzed by the overwhelming chaos of self-education. My mission is to build the structured, confidence-building bridge people like me need to get to the other side, without the absurd time and financial cost associated with undertaking such an endeavor. I believe when truly motivated individuals are armed with the right tools and have a clear path forward, they have potential to learn anything.
